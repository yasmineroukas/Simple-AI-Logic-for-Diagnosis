# 🧠 Simple AI Logic for Diagnosis
## 📌 Description:
This project demonstrates a basic expert system for medical diagnosis using logical inference. It simulates how an AI can derive possible medical conditions based on a set of symptoms and diagnosis rules.The system is implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook, using hardcoded facts (symptoms) and rules (if-then statements) to infer potential diseases.
## 🛠️ Features:
Representation of medical knowledge using facts and rules
Logical inference engine to deduce diagnoses
Interactive examples of how the system reaches conclusions
Easily extendable rule base
